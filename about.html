    <div class="diffrent"><p><a class="at-microverse" href="">At Microverse,</a> students learn through a 
        very unique approach — by pair programming and collaborating with
         other students in real time, just as they would with colleagues
         of a distributed team in a real company.</p></div>

            <p>The Founder’s Story (Ariel Camus)
                I grew up in Argentina, went to school in Europe, built a business in San Francisco, taught in Africa, and lived in Asia for a year. In my life's journey, I’ve seen that talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not.
                Nowadays, the Internet makes it possible for anyone to connect with global jobs regardless of where they were born or live. However, paying for a great education is incredibly difficult for most people.
                I started Microverse to change that to help people from all 
                around the world learn software development at no upfront 
                cost and to connect them with global jobs no matter their location, gender, or background.</p>
